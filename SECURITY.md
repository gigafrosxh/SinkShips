## Reporting a Vulnerability

Right now there are not really any vulnerabilities, because the game is still Singleplayer.
But in future versions there will we the possibility to play online against other players, 
wich could potentially add a few security risks.

As I said, there are no vulnerabilities right now, because the game is still Singleplayer,
but when it is also playable in Multiplayer, there will be a Security Update as soon as 
possible after hearing about a security issue. If you find a vulnerability, you can contact
me per mail (gigafrosxh@gmail.com). I will answer as soon as possible.
